            <h4>What we're about</h4>
            <p>The Brothers Grimm, Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm, were German academics, cultural researchers,
                linguists, lexicographers, folklore collectors and writers. They established a methodology for
                collecting and recording folk stories that became the foundation for folklore studies.</p>

            <h4>Our humble beginings</h4>
            <p>Both brothers were born and raised in Hanau in the Landgraviate of Hesse–Kassel within the Holy Roman
                Empire, in present–day Germany. Jacob was born on January 4, 1785 and Wilhelm was born the following
                year on February 24, 1786. They were born to Phillip Wilhelm Grimm and Dorothea Grimm and were the two
                eldest siblings out of nine. In 1791, the family moved to the countryside in a town called Steinau,
                where the brothers enjoyed playing in the open fields surrounding their home. They got a strict Lutheran
                education at home from private tutors, and later attended local schools. <br>In 1798, he and Wilhelm
                left their family to attend Friedrichsgymnasium in Kassel, a school that focused on music and foreign
                language. The two brothers became particularly close during this time.

                Upon graduation, they both went on to attend the University of Marburg to study law, like their father.

            <p>After their time at University of Marburg, the brothers split up for some time. Jacob accepted a job in
                Paris as a research assistant to provide for the rest of his family. He went on to become a librarian in
                Kassel, where Wilhelm joined him after seeking treatments for his heart and respiratory ailments. At
                this time, they also began to collect old books and ask friends and acquaintances to tell them tales,
                which they gathered and intended to use to write a book on German history. In 1830, they moved to
                Göttingen, where they both got jobs at the University of Göttingen, Jacob as a professor and head
                librarian, and Wilhelm as a professor.</p>

            <h4>Our stories</h4>
            <p>Grimm's Fairy Tales was originally published as Children's and Household Tales in 1812. It contained 86
                stories, and by the seventh edition in 1857, it contained over 200 unique fairy tales. The stories were
                about German families and children and the ways in which they reacted to their circumstances, and the
                moral messages these stories contained derived from a German oral tradition that the Grimms brothers
                wanted to preserve. Later, any mention of fairies was omitted, as they were seen as being ''too
                French.'' In this way, they also participated in the wider effort of the time to oppose French
                domination.

                The Grimms brothers strongly believed that the purest form of culture was linguistic and history–based.
                They saw the violent and disturbing aspects of the stories as reflections of the culture, which often
                emphasized teaching obedience through fear. However, as new editions of the book were released, they
                removed major disturbing scenes and events to make the stories more palatable for children.
